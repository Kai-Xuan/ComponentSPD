Component Symmetric Positive Definite matrices (CSPD) for describing image sets.  

The ETH-80 dataset is needed to be downloaded(https://github.com/Kai-Xuan/ETH-80/),   
and put 8 filefolders(visual image sets from 8 different categories) into filefolder '.\ETH-80\'.   
Please run 'read_ETH.m' to generate CSPD matrices. Then run 'run_ETH.m' for image set classification.   

For more experiment, you can test on Virus dataset (https://github.com/Kai-Xuan/Virus/)
